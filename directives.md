## Directives in Angular

There are 3 types of Directives:

  1. Components
    - Components are just directives with templates. Under the hood, they use the directive API and give us a cleaner way to define them.

  2. Structural directives
    - These are specifically tailored to create and destroy DOM elements.
    - examples:
      - `*ngIf`

  3. Attribute directives
    - Attribute directives manipulate the DOM by changing its behavior and appearance.
    - examples:
      - `[ngClass]`
